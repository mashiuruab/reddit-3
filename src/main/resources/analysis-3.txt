Submission :

"num_comments"
"author"
"ups"
"downs"
"over_18"
"media_embed"
"secure_media_embed"




1. Find the authors with most influence on submission. It is  some kind of finding
the users with submission where lots of  comments done. (influenceAuthor)

2. Find based on what the influence (comment influence) varies foremost (like  upvote,  downvote,
numberOfComments, over_18) among the submissions of subreddits. Here  we can find the pairwise cdf of (upvote,
numberOfComments), (downvote, numberOfComments), (over_18, numberOfComments), (media_embed,
numberOfComments)  etc.

Suppose for  pariwise cdf  (upvote, numberOfComments) we can show if there is any relation between
numberOfComments  and upvote  count among all  of the submission available in reddit.

The same  goes for  other parts also (downvote, numberOfComments), (over_18, numberOfComments),
(media_embed, numberOfComments)

2.1 (upvote, numberOfComments)
2.2 (downvote, numberOfComments)
2.3 (over_18, numberOfComments)
2.4 (media_embed, numberOfComments)

(influenceMatrix)

3. Find subreddits with number of submissions. (Subreddits with  most number of submissions)

(mostsubmission)

4. Is there any relation between comments per subreddit and  submission per subreddit ?
(Is there any relation of having more/less comment if a subreddit  has  more/less submission)

(comments per subreddit)

5. Number of Submissions created on each day.

6. Number of Comments created on each day.

7. Number of Comments done on each hour. (Try to find  relation if the number of comment varies with
other time of the day specially with that target hate hour we have found in the first project)

8. Number of Submissions done on each hour (Try to find  relation if the number of submission varies with
other time of the day specially with that target hate hour we have found in the first project)
